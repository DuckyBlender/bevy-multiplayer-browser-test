# bevy-multiplayer-browser-test

Little test to see if I can get a multiplayer game working in the browser with Bevy.

Many thanks to [johanhelsing.studio](https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/extreme-bevy) for this post on how to get Bevy working in the browser.

I'm going to try to create a mouse movement thing soon!
